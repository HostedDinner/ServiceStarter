# Service Starter

This is a simple Application for Windows, which can start a service and stop it. The user must have the right privileges for starting/stopping the service!
This can be done for example in this way: [see Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18856461/5905665)

It is written in C++ (uses features of C++11) and is small in size.

There are very less safety fallbacks for failing. Because the code is a little bit messy.
